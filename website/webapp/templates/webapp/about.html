        <h2>Our Objective</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Create: A user-friendly form makes it simple for users to add new entries, such as contacts, records, or products.</li>
            <li>Read: The program lets users see and search for records effectively by displaying data in a well-organized table format with pagination and sorting options.</li>
            <li>Update: It's simple to maintain the data current because users can change previous items straight from the dashboard.</li>
            <li>Delete: Data that is no longer needed can be easily removed from the system, ensuring that it is disposed of in a timely manner.</li>
        </ol>
